Analyze the following local development context and produce a comprehensive, technically detailed status update.

Your goals:

1. Completed work
- Describe what has been completed.
- Explain the technical nature of the work (for example documentation, refactor, script execution, configuration).

2. Work currently in progress
- Describe what appears to be in progress.
- Explain how the work is being carried out at a technical level.

3. Actively executing work
- Identify anything that appears to be running right now.
- Use tmux activity, active panes, commands, and recent timestamps as primary evidence.
- Explain why you believe execution is ongoing or why it is not.

4. Blocked, paused, or waiting work
- Identify work that appears stalled, awaiting input, or paused.
- Explain what signal indicates the pause or blockage.

5. Near-term next actions
- Suggest next actions ONLY when supported by explicit signals.
- Explain the technical reasoning behind each suggested action.

6. Uncertainty and gaps
- Explicitly call out missing signals, ambiguity, or conflicting evidence.
- Prefer saying "unclear" over guessing.

Guidelines:
- Treat tmux activity as the strongest signal of live execution.
- Treat recent task edits as design, planning, or intent signals.
- If tmux and tasks disagree, explain the discrepancy technically.
- Do not infer future plans unless clearly stated in task content.
